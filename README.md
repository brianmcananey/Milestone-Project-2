## 2. UX

Whilst designing and creating this website I have taken into account the five planes of UX design, strategy, scope, structure, skeleton and surface.

### 2.1 Strategy

This plane is the first, it involves identifying the goals and objectives of the site and the user. By identifying these first, design decisions can be made that meet these goals.

**User and site goals**
Target users for History Box :
- Students from Years 7 through to GCSE.
- Teachers to provide a quiz for students.
- People who want to learn more about history.

First time and returning user goals:
- I want to easily and intuitively find my way around the site.
- I want to test my current knowledge of various history topics.
- I want to easily find different year group quizes.
- I want to easily find social media links.

One of the main goals for my website was to create an intuitive experience making the page easy to navigate without the user having to think too much about their next move. With the understanding that my user demographic is most likely viewing the website across a variety of devices, I have made sure that the site is fully responsive across screen sizes in order to optimize user experience.

### 2.2 Scope

The second plane of UX looks at the **scope** of the website. What does the user have to do in order to reach both the user and the site owners goals for the website.

#### Features <!-- omit in toc -->

|:---:|---|
|`Nav Bar`|A responsive navigation bar that allows for easy navigation to every page of the site|
|`H1`|Used for the title of the quiz|
|`H2`|Used for the quiz tagline|
|`Button`|A button navigating to the how to page|
|`Button`|A button navigating to the quiz page|
|`Footer`|A simple footer section with site creator info, a text link and social media links|

|How To Page|A page that explains how the quiz will work|

|`Buttons`|Four buttons that log the users choice of answer|
|`Footer`|A simple footer section with site creator info, a text link and social media links|


### 2.3 Structure

The structure plane deals with the organising and arrangment of elements within the user interface. Creating userflows to define how the user will interact with the page. A big goal of the structure plane is to ensure that the users can easily find and access the information they need.


### 2.4 Skeleton

This plane is a more refined view of the user interface. Looking at the layout and visual hierarchy to ensure the site is both visually appealing and functional. I created a set of wireframes for different screen sizes, this is a simplified version of the final product, removing colour, typography, imagery to create a basic view of website and establish the layout.

| Mobile Wireframes | Desktop Wireframes |
|:---:|:---:|
|![Mobile Wireframes](add wireframe)|![Tablet and Desktop Wireframes](add wireframe)|


### 2.5 Surface

The surface plane is the last layer and deals with the aesthetics of the user interface. This includes colour palettes, typography, graphics and visual style. The goal of this plane is to create a page that is visually pleasing and engaging for the user.

| Type | Image | Description|
|:---:|---|---|
|Typography|![google fonts]()| I opted to use 'Montserrat' across the entire site as it is a simple and easy to read font that has a number of different style options that can be utilised in different areas. |
|Colours|![Colour Palette]()|I chose to use a simple primary colour palette to keep the pages looking clean and easy to read. I chose a simple black and white colours for the quizes so they are easier to read.|
